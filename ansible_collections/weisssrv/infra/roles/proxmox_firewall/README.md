# Proxmox Firewall Role

Manages Proxmox VE firewall at cluster, host, and guest levels. Configures IPSets for network groupings and Security Groups for reusable rule templates, plus the `monitoring@pve` user/ACL/API-token used by the Prometheus exporters.

## What This Role Manages

### Cluster Firewall (/etc/pve/firewall/cluster.fw)
- Global firewall options (`policy_in: DROP`, `policy_out: ACCEPT`)
- IPSet definitions: `admin_lan`, `admin_ts` and `smb_clients` come from the
  `proxmox_firewall_*_cidrs` variables; every other set (`core-cluster`,
  `k3s_nodes`, `pve_hosts`, `nfs_clients`, …) is rendered from inventory
- `[ALIASES]`: derived from inventory (a host sets `firewall_alias`, optionally
  `firewall_alias_comment`), plus `proxmox_firewall_extra_aliases` for addresses
  that are not inventory hosts. An extra with the same name wins
- Security Group definitions — **edited directly in `templates/cluster.fw.j2`**,
  not driven by a variable. The shipped set is a starting policy; a deployment
  with a different service mix edits the template or appends
  `proxmox_firewall_cluster_rules`
- Cluster-wide rules (`proxmox_firewall_cluster_rules`, default empty)

### Host Firewall (/etc/pve/nodes/{node}/host.fw)
- Per-host firewall enable + base group references (sg-pve-cluster,
  sg-host-admin, sg-metrics; NAS hosts add sg-nfs-server/sg-smb-server)
- Optional host egress allowlist + trailing OUT DROP (see "Egress filtering")
- Inbound drop logging via `proxmox_firewall_log_level_in` (default `nolog`; flip
  to `info` for triage of dropped inbound traffic — policy_in is DROP)
- Host-specific extra rules (`proxmox_firewall_host_rules`, default empty)

### Guest Firewall (/etc/pve/firewall/{vmid}.fw)
- Per-VM/LXC firewall configuration: `enable: 1` + one `GROUP <sg>` line per
  entry in the guest's `guest_security_groups`
- Optional `policy_out` (`guest_firewall_policy_out`, e.g. `DROP` to turn a
  group's OUT ACCEPT rules into an enforced egress allowlist)

### Monitoring user and API token (pveum)
- Creates the `monitoring@pve` user, grants `PVEAuditor` at `/`, and creates
  the `monitoring@pve!exporter` API token (`--privsep 0`) — run once per
  invocation, cluster-wide. The token secret is only printed at creation; the
  role discards it (`no_log`) and tells the operator how to recover/rotate it
  (`/etc/pve/priv/token.cfg`, or token remove + add) into the
  "Proxmox API Token" 1Password item.

## Configuration

There is no `security_groups` variable and no dict-style `firewall_ipsets`
map — groups live in the template, and IPSet membership is declared per host:

```yaml
# In hosts.yml — per-HOST membership list: each named IPSet gains this
# host's ansible_host IP. templates/ipsets.j2 renders every discovered set.
dns-01:
  firewall_ipsets:
    - core-cluster
  guest_security_groups:   # rendered into /etc/pve/firewall/<vmid>.fw
    - sg-vm-admin
    - sg-dns

# In group_vars/all.yml — non-host entries (VIPs etc.) per IPSet:
firewall_ipset_special_entries:
  k3s_nodes:
    - ip: 192.168.0.161
      comment: k3s API VIP
```

```yaml
# Aliases follow the same shape: a host contributes one, non-hosts are listed.
dns-01:
  firewall_alias: dns-01
  firewall_alias_comment: Primary DNS server

proxmox_firewall_extra_aliases:
  - name: api-vip
    cidr: 192.168.0.161
    comment: k3s API VIP
```

### Required input

`proxmox_firewall_admin_lan_cidrs` has **no default**: an empty `admin_lan`
IPSet would lock :22 and :8006 out of every node, so the render fails loudly
rather than quietly producing that. `proxmox_firewall_admin_ts_cidrs` defaults
to the Tailscale CGNAT range and `proxmox_firewall_smb_client_cidrs` to the
admin LAN.

Two security groups take their addresses from variables rather than literals,
and admit nothing when left empty: `proxmox_firewall_immich_ml_clients`
(sg-immich-ml, an authless inference port — this list *is* the boundary) and
`proxmox_firewall_wan_wireguard_vips` (sg-k3s-ingress-pub, `-dest`-scoped so
the node's own :51820/udp — flannel wireguard-native — stays off the WAN).

To add or change a **security group**, edit `templates/cluster.fw.j2`.

`proxmox_firewall_host_group` (default `proxmox`) names the inventory group
holding the nodes.

## Files

- `tasks/main.yml` - Main orchestration (firewall configs + pveum monitoring user/token)
- `tasks/guest.yml` - Per-guest firewall deployment (included when `vmid` is set)
- `tasks/deploy-pmxcfs-config.yml` - Shared pmxcfs-safe publisher for the `.fw`
  files (see "Writing into pmxcfs" below); used by cluster.fw, host.fw, and guest configs
- `templates/cluster.fw.j2` - Cluster firewall with IPSets and Security Groups
- `templates/host.fw.j2` - Per-host firewall rules
- `templates/guest.fw.j2` - Per-guest firewall rules
- `templates/ipsets.j2` - IPSet generation from inventory membership lists

### Writing into pmxcfs

`/etc/pve` is the Proxmox clustered FUSE filesystem (pmxcfs). It auto-enforces
`root:www-data 0640` on the firewall files and **rejects every explicit
`chown` / `chmod` / `utime` with `EPERM`**. Ansible's `template`/`copy` land
content through `atomic_move`, whose fallback runs `shutil.copy2` (which calls
`utime`) and then re-applies the requested owner/group/mode — so a first create
or any content change false-fails on "Operation not permitted" even though the
bytes were written (`unsafe_writes` does not route around it on ansible-core
2.20+). `tasks/deploy-pmxcfs-config.yml` therefore renders each config to a
staging file on the node's normal root filesystem (`proxmox_firewall_staging_dir`),
then publishes it with a plain `cp` — no metadata syscalls — only when the live
content differs, letting pmxcfs stamp its enforced ownership and mode.

## Dependencies

None - foundational role

## Security

- Default deny with explicit allow rules
- Separate admin access (LAN + Tailscale)
- Service-specific Security Groups
- Per-guest isolation with opt-in networking

## Egress filtering

Inbound is default-deny; host-originated **egress** is `ACCEPT` unless
`proxmox_firewall_egress_filtering` is set (role default `false`; **production
enables it for all six Proxmox hosts** via `group_vars/proxmox.yml`). When
enabled it applies the
`sg-host-egress` allowlist (DNS/NTP/HTTP(S)/Tailscale/corosync/SSH/NFS/SMTP/
migration) and appends an explicit trailing `OUT DROP` rule in `host.fw`.
`pve-firewall` honours OUT *rules* in `host.fw` but **ignores** the host-level
`policy_out` option (that key is only effective in `cluster.fw`), so the trailing
`OUT DROP` rule — not a policy setting — is what enforces default-deny. Guest
traffic is unaffected by the host rules; guests opt in separately via
`guest_firewall_policy_out: "DROP"` (smtp-relay does, turning its
`sg-smtp-relay` OUT rules into an enforced egress allowlist).

Rolling out to a new host (or re-enabling after an opt-out) — a missing
allowlist entry can break a node or remote access:

1. Set `proxmox_firewall_egress_filtering: true` in the host's `host_vars`
   (start with a non-critical compute node), deploy, then validate with
   `pve-firewall compile` and confirm the node stays reachable, joins the cluster
   (`pvecm status`), and can reach apt/Tailscale.
2. The `OUT DROP` rule logs dropped OUT packets at `info` — review
   `journalctl -k | grep 'DROP'` (or the kernel log) and extend `sg-host-egress`
   in `cluster.fw.j2` for any legitimate egress that was missed (e.g. a service
   on a non-standard port).
3. Once stable, roll out to the remaining hosts (or set it in `group_vars`).

## Testing

```bash
# Test from external host
ping 192.168.0.150  # Should work if in admin_lan
ssh eric@192.168.0.150  # Should work if in admin IPSets

# View firewall status on Proxmox
pve-firewall status
pve-firewall simulate

# View IPSets
pvesh get /cluster/firewall/ipset

# View Security Groups
pvesh get /cluster/firewall/groups
```
