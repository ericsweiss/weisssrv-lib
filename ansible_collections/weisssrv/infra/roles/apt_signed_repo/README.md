# weisssrv.infra.apt_signed_repo

Shared pipeline to add a **fingerprint-verified signed APT repository**. It owns
the boilerplate that drifted across the roles that install upstream packages
from a vendor apt repo: ensure the keyring dir, stat the keyring, (optionally)
install gnupg, download the signing key, verify its **primary-key fingerprint**
exactly, dearmor it into a binary keyring, clean up, then add the `deb
[signed-by=...]` source.

Callers in this collection: **`alloy_host`** (Grafana), **`docker_engine`**
(Docker CE) and **`k3s`** (the NVIDIA container toolkit). Each keeps its own key
URL, fingerprint, keyring path, repo line and apt filename — the role only owns
the mechanics.

The keyring is the persistent artifact: the download → verify → dearmor →
cleanup sub-sequence is gated on its absence so the role is idempotent. Key
rotation is delete-the-keyring-first; callers do their own legacy-keyring
cleanup (old `.asc`/`.list` files) before the include.

## Roles that stay standalone

**`tailscale`** shares only the fingerprint-verify snippet and is intentionally
**not** converted. It force-refetches a pre-dearmored `.noarmor.gpg` into a
staging path on every run (so a rotated upstream key is picked up without manual
file removal), verifies the fingerprint, then copies it into the trusted keyring
— a different rotation model than this role's stat-gated download. Folding it in
would regress that behavior.

## How callers invoke it

```yaml
- name: Install <vendor> signed APT repository
  ansible.builtin.include_role:
    name: weisssrv.infra.apt_signed_repo
  vars:
    apt_signed_repo_key_url: https://vendor.example/gpg.key
    apt_signed_repo_fingerprint: 0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF01234567
    apt_signed_repo_keyring_path: /etc/apt/keyrings/vendor.gpg
    apt_signed_repo_repo_line: "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/vendor.gpg] https://vendor.example stable main"
    apt_signed_repo_filename: vendor
```

## Parameters

| Variable | Meaning | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `apt_signed_repo_key_url` | URL of the (ASCII-armored) signing key | yes |
| `apt_signed_repo_fingerprint` | Expected primary-key fingerprint (no spaces) | yes |
| `apt_signed_repo_keyring_path` | Dearmored binary keyring destination | yes |
| `apt_signed_repo_repo_line` | Full `deb [signed-by=...] ...` sources line | yes |
| `apt_signed_repo_filename` | apt `sources.list.d` filename (no extension) | yes |
| `apt_signed_repo_when` | Extra gate threaded through every task (e.g. a skip flag) | no (default `true`) |
| `apt_signed_repo_install_gnupg` | Install gnupg on every run (the existing-keyring re-verify also needs gpg) when nothing else guarantees it | no (default `false`) |
| `apt_signed_repo_keyring_mode` | Explicit keyring mode; empty leaves gpg's default | no (default `""`) |
| `apt_signed_repo_stage_dir` | Root-only directory the key is staged in | no (default `/run/apt-signed-repo`) |
| `apt_signed_repo_tmp_key` | Staging path for the download | no (default `<stage_dir>/<keyring-basename>.download`) |
| `apt_signed_repo_update_cache` | Refresh the apt cache when the repo is added; set `false` for hermetic tests/staged rollouts | no (default `true`) |

## Staging path

Fingerprint verification and dearmor are separate SSH invocations against the
downloaded file, so anything that can rewrite that file in between chooses which
key apt trusts. The role therefore stages into a root-owned `0700` directory
under a non-world-writable parent, and removes it after dearmor. Override
`apt_signed_repo_stage_dir` only with a path holding the same property —
`/tmp/...` does not.
