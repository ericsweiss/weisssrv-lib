# Usage: find-pve-host-for-vm.sh <vmid> <host1> [host2 ...]
# Exit 0 with host on stdout if found; exit 1 with diagnostics on stderr.
#
# Resolution strategy (HA-resilient):
#   1. Find the first reachable host from the provided list.
#   2. Try ha-manager status on that host (for HA-managed services).
#   3. Fall back to pvesh /cluster/resources for any cluster-known VM.
#   4. Fall back to scanning each host with qm status (works without cluster).

# this script ever gets reused outside the Proxmox cluster.

# whole status line into $NODE instead of falling through to steps 3/4.
