"""Tests for scripts/check-lib-pins.py (the library pin gate).

Exercises the drift, branch-ref and missing-include cases against synthetic CI
files, plus the --project / --ref-var overrides a consumer needs when it pins a
fork or names its variable differently.

CANONICAL SUITE. The library's own .gitlab-ci.yml uses `local:` includes rather
than pinning itself, so there is no self-check here. A consumer that vendors
check-lib-pins.py vendors this file too, and adds only its own smoke test
asserting the real .gitlab-ci.yml passes — behavioural cases belong here, not in
a consumer's copy. Those copies are byte-gated: they are registered in
scripts/vendored-paths.yml and compared by scripts/check-vendored-copies.py.
