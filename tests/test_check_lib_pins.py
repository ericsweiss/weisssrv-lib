"""Tests for scripts/check-lib-pins.py (the library pin gate).

Exercises the drift, branch-ref and missing-include cases against synthetic CI
files, plus the --project / --ref-var overrides a consumer needs when it pins a
fork or names its variable differently.

This library's OWN .gitlab-ci.yml uses `local:` includes rather than pinning
itself, so there is no self-check here — the gate ships for CONSUMERS to vendor,
and each one asserts its real file (see weisssrv scripts/test_check_lib_pins.py).
